Day three (week one) code can be found 
[on the master branch under ruby/day3](https://github.com/mbbx6spp/7languages7weeks/tree/master/ruby/day3)

In terms of interesting things learned along the way in this chapter was:
* Realization how much I care about coding style. See [my line comments](https://github.com/mbbx6spp/7languages7weeks/tree/master/ruby/day3/selfstudy.rb)
about the ActsAsCsv mixin module for more information.
* Didn't even consider adding class scope methods using +missing_method+ before, but very intuitive for 
those that have done this on the instance scope already (like me).

I know, I am getting lazier each day. I will hopefully pick up during Io week if I can (it'll be a busy week for me),
but I will work through the exercises at least!
