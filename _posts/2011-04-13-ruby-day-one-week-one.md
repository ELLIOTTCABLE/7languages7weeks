I wasn't expecting to be wowed by this day's chapter considering Ruby is
one of the programming languages I know well. And I wasn't, but I did like
the faux argument (to make a point clear) by the author that Ruby is "strongly
typed". I read this and immediately woke up. I thought "what on earth?".
Actually I thought something else, but to keep it family friendly, we'll
go with that version. Then I realized there was a footnote to this.
"Aaah, good".

The exercises were very easy for me, but it made me think of better ways
to teach others about Ruby next time I need to. Give them the tools, a gentle
introduction highlighting a handful of key points, arm them with the API docs
and then force them to do stuff they don't necessarily know how to do so they
can get acquainted with the documentation and structure of the standard
libraries. Before my approach was a lot more guided. I think I prefer this
approach already.
