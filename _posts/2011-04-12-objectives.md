Tomorrow I will start the #7languages7weeks challenge with a group of other 
established and budding developers. This seemed strange to a few of my peers 
as they note I am very strong in two of the languages to be reviewed in this
book, adequately familiar with another three, leaving only two langauges (Io 
and Prolog) that I have virtually no knowledge of (except historical contetxt 
of the latter).

**I am embarking on a journey to rediscover my inner *n00b* once more.**

What a very strange thing to say some may say, but I think there is a quality 
of a *n00b* that I have lost that I would very much like to regain. It is the 
ability to just try anything without fear. So far I have found the more I know on 
a topic the more I restrict my activities, because *I know?* this or that will 
not work the way I want it to. Guess what? Sometimes I don't know, because I 
don't always make the right assumptions to be in line with reality.

Sometimes just taking a fresh look at a topic in the eyes of a *n00b* will reveal 
a something I missed before.

Over Christmas I bought the Erlang/OTP in Action book (Manning). It was a present 
to myself and it was an excellent present. Not only did I learn more 
about OTP (which is really why I bought the book in the first place), but in 
the previous two Erlang books I had already read and worked through I missed
binary comprehensions. In itself this is probably not a big deal. Out of all 
the things in Erlang, the language, it is probably one of the least used (I 
will bet). But learning about binary comprehensions somehow made me see Erlang 
in a way I hadn't before. Something I cannot verbalize, but it changed my 
coding style and the way I solve problems in Erlang. And that is OK with me.

In short, I am on this #7languages7weeks trail to take me somewhere I didn't expect.

Happy travels to all.
