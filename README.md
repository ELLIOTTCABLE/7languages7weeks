\#7languages7weeks Challenge
============================

This is a repository journaling my journey through the #7languages7weeks 
challenge.

Overview
--------

Based on the following book from Pragmatic Programmers:
* [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&tag=supo-20&ie=UTF8&qid=1307764498&sr=1-1)

First I imported the source code of the book, which is available for download
on the Pragmatic Programmers website.

I will add to these samples over the course of my journey to compare these 
langauges side-by-side.
